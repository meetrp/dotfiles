generic
=======

this started as a temporary storage for all my unclassified work including code. much like /tmp in linux systems.

slowly this evolved into my main store for all my configuration pieces like my bashrcs, vimrcs, etc...
though the remnant files from the original purpose of this repo is still around, i have moved my usage away and to where it is today. eventually i will/might remove the stale code.

the primary files of interest would be the following:

| file | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| .vimrc |  vim configuration with useful statusline, colors & smart-tab |
| github_TODO.md_gen.sh | generate TODO.md automatically from the code |
| .git-commit-template.txt | template to make git commits useful |
| init.el | emacs configuration (similar to vimrc) |
| eclipse/c_formatter_KnR.xml | eclipse c/c++ formatter |
| nat.sh | convert regular laptop/desktop/vm linux into router |
| .bashrc | bash configuration with useful prompts and aliases |
